# This project allows users to explore, view details, search, create and manage superheroes.
The project integrates dynamic API data, user authentication, local storage-based CRUD functionality and a clean, responsive UI.

While working on this project, I learned and successfully implemented the following:

1. Full authentication flow (sign up, log in, validation, user persistence).
2. Hybrid data management - integration of external API data + user-created superheroes saved locally.
3. Advanced CRUD functionality with form validation, editing and deletion of custom content.
4. Searchbar that filters results instantly, uses smart debouncing to avoid unnecessary requests and displays an interactive dropdown.
5. Error handling for API failures, empty results, validation errors and invalid inputs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Koteykee/VuePosts

2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
3. Run application
```sh

Done! 😄
